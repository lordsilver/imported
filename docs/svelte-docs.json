It will be used if the component's consumer doesn't specify the prop on the component (or if its initial value is undefined) when instantiating the component. Note that if the values of props are subsequently updated, then any prop whose value is not specified will be set to undefined (rather than its initial value).\n\nIn development mode (see the compiler options), a warning will be printed if no default initial value is provided and the consumer does not specify a value. To squelch this warning, ensure that a default initial value is specified, even if it is undefined.\n\n<script>\n    export let bar = 'optional default initial value';\n    export let baz = undefined;\n</script>If you export a const, class or function, it is readonly from outside the component.

This means that yDependent will not be updated when x is updated in the following example:\n\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<script>\n    let x = 0;\n    let y = 0;\n\n    /** @param {number} value */\n    function setY(value) {\n        y = value;\n    }\n\n    $: yDependent = y;\n    $: setY(x);\n</script>Moving the line $: yDependent = y below $: setY(x) will cause yDependent to be updated when x is updated.\n\nIf a statement consists entirely of an assignment to an undeclared variable, Svelte will inject a let declaration on your behalf.\n\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<script>\n    /** @type {number} */\n    export let num;\n\n    // we don't need to declare `squared` and `cubed`\n    // — Svelte does it for us\n    $: squared = num * num;\n    $: cubed = squared * num;\n</script>","rank":null},{"breadcrumbs":["Svelte components","<script>","4.

Calling an unsubscribe function must stop its subscription, and its corresponding subscription function must not be called again by the store.\nA store may optionally contain a .set method, which must accept as its argument a new value for the store, and which synchronously calls all of the store's active subscription functions. Such a store is called a writable store.\n\nFor interoperability with RxJS Observables, the .subscribe method is also allowed to return an object with an .unsubscribe method, rather than return the unsubscription function directly.

Using $$props will not perform as well as references to a specific prop because changes to any prop will cause Svelte to recheck all usages of $$props.

Svelte needs to be able to see the element's value directly in the markup in these cases so that it can link it to the bound variable.\n\n\nSometimes, the attribute order matters as Svelte sets attributes sequentially in JavaScript. For example, <input type=&quot;range&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;1&quot; value={0.5} step=&quot;0.1&quot;/>, Svelte will attempt to set the value to 1 (rounding up from 0.5 as the step by default is 1), and then set the step to 0.1. To fix this, change it to <input type=&quot;range&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;1&quot; step=&quot;0.1&quot; value={0.5}/>.\n\n\nAnother example is <img src=&quot;...&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; />.

It is important to note that not all logic belongs within a component - this includes concerns such as data transformation, cross-component state management, and logging, among others. Remember that the Svelte library has its own test suite, so you do not need to write tests to validate implementation details provided by Svelte.\n\nA Svelte application will typically have three different types of tests: Unit, Component, and End-to-End (E2E).\n\nUnit Tests: Focus on testing business logic in isolation. Often this is validating individual functions and edge cases. By minimizing the surface area of these tests they can be kept lean and fast, and by extracting as much logic as possible from your Svelte components more of your application can be covered using them. When creating a new SvelteKit project, you will be asked whether you would like to setup Vitest for unit testing. There are a number of other test runners that could be used as well.\n\nComponent Tests: Validating that a Svelte component mounts and interacts as expected throughout its lifecycle requires a tool that provides a Document Object Model (DOM). Components can be compiled (since Svelte is a compiler and not a normal library) and mounted to allow asserting against element structure, listeners, state, and all the other capabilities provided by a Svelte component. Tools for component testing range from an in-memory implementation like jsdom paired with a test runner like Vitest to solutions that leverage an actual browser to provide a visual testing capability such as Playwright or Cypress.\n\nEnd-to-End Tests: To ensure your users are able to interact with your application it is necessary to test it as a whole in a manner as close to production as possible. This is done by writing end-to-end (E2E) tests which load and interact with a deployed version of your application in order to simulate how the user will interact with your application. When creating a new SvelteKit project, you will be asked whether you would like to setup Playwright for end-to-end testing. There are many other E2E test libraries available for use as well.\n\nSome resources for getting started with testing:\n\nSvelte Testing Library\nSvelte Component Testing in Cypress\nExample using vitest\nExample using uvu test runner with JSDOM\nTest Svelte components using Vitest &amp; Playwright\nComponent testing with WebdriverIO","rank":null},{"breadcrumbs":["Frequently asked questions","Is there a router?"],"href":"/docs/faq#is-there-a-router","content":"The official routing library is SvelteKit.

When the compiler can't see what elements a style selector applies to, there would be two bad options for keeping it:\n\nIf it keeps the selector and adds the scoping class to it, the selector will likely not match the expected elements in the component, and they definitely won't if they were created by a child component or {@html ...}.\nIf it keeps the selector without adding the scoping class to it, the given style will become a global style, affecting your entire page.\n\nIf you need to style something that Svelte can't identify at compile time, you will need to explicitly opt into global styles by using :global(...). But also keep in mind that you can wrap :global(...) around only part of a selector. .foo :global(.bar) { ... } will style any .bar elements that appear within the component's .foo elements. As long as there's some parent element in the current component to start from, partially global selectors like this will almost always be able to get you what you want.","rank":null},{"breadcrumbs":["Frequently asked questions","Is Svelte v2 still available?"],"href":"/docs/faq#is-svelte-v2-still-available","content":"New features aren't being added to it, and bugs will probably only be fixed if they are extremely nasty or present some sort of security vulnerability.\n\nThe documentation is still available here.","rank":null},{"breadcrumbs":["Frequently asked questions","How do I do hot module reloading?"],"href":"/docs/faq#how-do-i-do-hot-module-reloading","content":"We recommend using SvelteKit, which supports HMR out of the box and is built on top of Vite and svelte-hmr.
